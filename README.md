# Simulation of Evolution of Aggression

## Overview

This Python script simulates the evolution of aggression in a population of two types of agents: "dove" and "hawk." The agents compete for food, reproduce, and adapt their strategies over multiple generations. This README provides an overview of the simulation and how to run it.

## Simulation Details

- **Agents**: The simulation consists of a population of agents, each with a strategy of either "dove" or "hawk."

- **Interactions**: Agents interact with each other, and their strategies determine their outcomes. The interactions result in agents gaining or losing food.

- **Reproduction**: Agents can reproduce under certain conditions, and new agents inherit the strategy of their parent.

- **Survival**: Agents need to accumulate a certain amount of food to survive and remain in the population.

- **Data Collection**: The simulation collects data on the population dynamics of doves and hawks over multiple generations.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip` if they are not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib plotly pandas
